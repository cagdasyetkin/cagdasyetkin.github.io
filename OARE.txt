Šalim-ahum writes to his son intending for him to come home. As such he instructs him to take care of some issues and leave others for another journey to Anatolia.  From another letters that discuss Ennam-Aššur's concerns about the Anatolians (AKT 3 67), it is clear that the discussion to bring Ennam-Aššur home was an ongoing one. Šalim-ahum in intent that Ennam-Aššur will leave his personal business in Anatolia, including matters regarding his own naruqqum, in the care of his brother Dan-Aššur during his return, demonstrating both the ease with which such a matter could be undertaken and its marked character as Šalim-ahum felt the need to explicitly discuss it. 
When Ennam-Aššur comes, Šalim-ahum desires him to arrive with several specific goods, including a table top (to be had from Agua son of ?ab-Aššur), half a talent of fine copper (part to be acquired in Kanesh and part in Hahhum). Perhaps in exchange, Šalim-ahum promises his son that he will give him 16 ½ shekels gold which Lipit-Suen(?) in Šimala apparently owes Ennam-Aššur. The specific goods may have been related to Ennam-Aššur's imminent marriage to the daughter of Šu-Hubur, who wrote Pušu-ken hoping to ensure that Ennam-Aššur was pleased during his time in Anatolia (VS 26 64).

Summary 
The topic of the preserved portion of the letter has to do with Pušu-ken purchasing real estate in Aššur. He was pursuing this activity as seen in several other letters (TTC 6, Schaeffer 22, TC 2 2). As evident from those letters, Šu-Hubur, a senior merchant also intimately involved with Pušu-ken's commerical operations, had been helping to arrange the purchase of a house for Pušu-ken, going so far as to conclude the purchase of the house. He did so without consulting Šalim-ahum, which frustrated the latter. Šalim-ahum had thought that a lack of competition for the house and patience woudl yeild a lwoer price. However, when Šu-Hubur closed the deal, Šalim-ahum still decided to pay for 10 of the 16 minas silver from his own accounts so that the entirety woudl not be taken out as a loan on Pušu-ken's behalf. While nothing in this letter eliminates the possibility that this letter discussed a differenc occasion on which Šaim-ahum had paid out silver for Pušu-ken in the process of helping him conclude the purchase of a house, it seems likely that these two events were one and the same. If so, then Šalim-ahum's allusion to the house(s) of Šu-Hubur having been seized a second time is difficult to parse. The rendering bete suggests that the legal sense of ?abatum refers somehow to the architectural structure rather than the household. Nonetheless, the most likely context for th eremark has something to do with financial consequences of the house purchase for which Šalim-ahum is seeking remuneration.

3-5You wrote me concerning the 1 mina of amutum-mineral which Belanum and the son of Elali brought. You said, "Sell it for gold or silver; do not sell it for copper." 
8-10I initiated legal proceedings against Ennam-Aššur in Wahšušana and I did not sell to him because he would not pay (the?) silver.

16-19The colony heard and they said, "Until m. do not xxx . Do not sell it to anyone." 19-20There is a verdict of the colony. 
20-22I enquired of Ennam-Aššur and Idi-Kubi. 22-24They said, "Send the amutam-mineral to Hartu." 24-27But you would say "A witness should come to the messengers!" (or?) "He should send it to you!" 
27-30I took the amutum-mineral to the man and afterwards, when he had sold it(?), he said, "Let me refine it." 
31-32I said, "I will not give you permission to refine it." 33-38He said, "Let me refine if after you depart so that if it turns for worse, my lord will acquire bad will towards him and me." 
38-40He refined the amutum and 2/3 mina in lumps came up. 41-43Both from the refining and the tithe(?) he/it ... losses of 4 shekels.

17-20I still had a claim against you of 2 2/3 minas 1 1/4 shekels of silver, the proceeds from the sale of the textiles transported by Ennam-Belum. 
21You said: ''The silver has been taken." 22-24But I forgot to seal it, (and) since I have no silver available to me I have taken it. 
24-27I also still had a claim of 16 shekels 15 grains of silver from the goods transported by the son of Irnuid. 
27-30
In all: 2 5/6 minas 7 1/3 shekels have been deducted, so the rest of your silver is 2 1/6 shekels.
 30It has been spent for you.

9-10Send me the 1/3 mina of silver plus the goods purchased in the City. 10 black textiles worth 5 or 6 (shekels) each plus 2 hides they refused to recieve on your account in the colony office, so you sent them with Šalim-beli to Durhumit.

23-28When I left for the city you said in your message: "Let our father take their price out of the silver of Ennam-Belum." 
28-29They had already let the silver leave to go to you, so he took it from out of my shipment. 30-31But you had not written me any message that I must give hiim the price of the donkey!

Ikunum received a 4 kutanum-textiles and one black textile from Šu-Ištar, which he convereted to silver at his location. As this is likely not in Kanesh, the rates are of interest: For kutanum-textiles: 13 shekels silver, for black textiles: 8 shekels silver, for tin, a 10:1 rate to silver.

Šalim-ahum wrote this letter in response to two other letters (BIN 4 61, I 426) written by La-qepum and Ili-alum, and La-qepum, Pušu-ken and Ili-alum respectively. He opens the letter by quoting snippets from both letters in a way that intermingles them without notice, the difference only clear when the two other letters are examined in conjunction. Šalim-ahum is clearly angry in this letter, about Ilabrat-bani illegally opening his cargo en route to Kanesh, and about the uneven charging of feed expenses.

Reacting to unpleasant reports

7-9He acted on his own authority and opened my package and took my tin! 10-11Instead of some random thief, he took my tin! 
12-13Cause him to pay a six shekel rate for my tin! 13-17I read that Iddin-abum son of Iddin-Is?tar paid 16 1/2 minas silver (for merchandise) from those very same goods, (paying) 1/2 mina (per kuta¯num-textile), and 7 shekels (tin per shekel silver). 
18-19He will not pay less than a 6 shekel rate for the tin! 
Leveling accusations and crafting narratives
20-27In the presence of Enlil-ba¯ni and Puzur-As?s?ur son of Ela¯li, he drove my goods and their goods together from here and the thief (i.e. Ilabrat-ba¯ni) broke up 1 or 2 ‘talents’ (i.e. sacks) of tin in addition to the hand tin which I gave to them. 
27-31In this way they who were there ‘informed’ the man so that he took from mine while they took away their merchandise intact. 
31-33As for the caravan of La¯-qe¯pum, they charged feed (expenses of) 45 shekels each. But as for them, they charged him at (only) a 20 shekel rate. 
35-36How is it that they took it out of my own merchandise? 36-38Did he take (anything) from their tin or did he take (anything) from their textiles? 
39-42They 'informed' him and he took from mine, and he returned their textiles and tin intact! 
Instructing measures to be taken

This letter is particularly interesting becasue of the relationship it highlights between Pušu-ken and the traveller. Somewhere in Anatolia, Ahu-waqar is making his way, perhaps back toward Kaneš. During the journey, it seems that he was waylaid while his donkeys were at teh disposal of an Ennam-Aššur, who had taken them to a guard post or the like. When Ennam-Aššur returned, he pressed Ahu-waqar to change the situation between himself and Pušu-ken. Ennam-Aššur held Ahu-waqar's hem or fringe,of siginificant legal importance, which rendered Ahu-waqar stuck. Pušu-ken and Ennam-Aššur had a dispute over silver, and he was using Ahu-waqar, successfully, as leverage. The tone of Ahu-waqar's letter reveals the interesting thing about the interchange. Though Ennam-Aššur coudl apparently tie Ahu-waqar close enough to force Pušu-ken to negotiate over the matter, Ahu-waqar still felt a need to importune Pušu-ken for help, explaining that he needed to be on his way, as though his interests were not necessarily obvious to Pušu-ken.

13-21I said, "The silver which he brought to Kaneš came and you and Pušu-ken discuss and if the silver returns to the property of Pušu-ken, let him take it, and if it returns to your property, you (will) take it."

26-28Should Amur-Aššur say: "Take my share (of the debt)"- do not oblige him! 29-30They are jointly responsible for the silver. 
30-31If he pays in accordance with their tablet, then receive it. 31-32If he does not pay you anything, say to him: 
33-34"We shall count interest in accordance with your tablet!" 34-35Set witnesses for him, and then write me what he answered you.

Requesting Assistance
21-23My dear father and lord, to whom else can I turn? 23-31Give me 4 or 5 donkeys on long terms which you are wont to let out and rustle the donkeys so they arrive in Purušhattum so that every shekel of silver may arise and the eye of Aššur may (smile on me?)

7-102 1/2 minas of refined silver (and) 10 1/6 shekels of pašallu-gold Iddin-Aššur, Al-tab's packer, brought to you.

22-26From the silver of Ea-šar that Al-beli brought, they want, both for paying the price for purchases and as much as he paid for your share, the silver for the limmum.  
27-28I myself gave gold to the limmum. 28-30They made a reckoning with the limmum and they need 3 or 4 minas of silver.

OARE Development:  Hooked up with Old Cuneiform Arrangement
This letter preserves Šu-Hubur's ongoing attempt to extract his assets from two people's property. The first person is Ikunum. Ikunum's health is failing and investors are trying to pull out their money before he dies (for more see explanation on Ikunum's failing health and finances). Some of Ikunum's investors have been able to get Ikunum to hand over the capital from his naruqqum fund, though at a dissapointing rate. If, like other known example, they bought shares valued at 1 mina of gold for four minas of silver, they are now only able to salvage half their investments. Šu-Hubur directs Pušu-ken to try to interact with Ikunum nicely in the hopes that Pušu-ken will be able to procure more than the Šu-Hubur's colleagues have been able, perhaps by as much as a mina of silver more. If Pušu-ken's efforst fail, Šu-Hubur is prepared to take legal matters to try to prevent such losses. At the end of the letter, Šu-Hubur also reminds Pušu-ken to collect a smaller amount of tin (5 minas) from Ikunum.
The second person is Lalum, who had purchased a talent tin from Šu-Hubur's goods when he met with caravaneers (Aššur-malik and Irma-Aššur) transporting those goods through Hahhum. Since then Lalum has passed away, and Šu-Hubur is trying collect the silver from that credit sale. Those managing the division of Lalum's estate tell him that he will have to seek collection elsewhere, though admitting that the likelihood is quite small that he will recover his money. Šu-Hubur then urges Pušu-ken to collect the silver wherever it can be found. Pušu-ken is to gather the caravaneers to witness the transaction.

Directing the pursuit to collect of some silver
3-8You wrote, (saying) "Ikunum's investors have gotten out 2 minas of silver for each mina of gold for their gold (shares)." 
9-12If you judge look on him kindly, then he will give you an additional, (i.e.) three mina rate, instead of two mina rate. 
12Come to an agreement (with him). 13-18If after the 2 minas he does give up to you an addition, write me so that I may impose his 'thirds' here and bind my silver in the city. 
Urging the collection of assets from a deceased merchant
Concerning the 1 talent of tin which Aššur-malik and Irma-Aššur sold to Lalum in Hahhum, I have written to you several times (saying) "Here, I requested silver from the estate of Lalum, and they said, 'Write to wherever you sold him the tin and take your silver there; (but) there is no silver belonging to Lalum in the feild (Anatolia).'" 
32-38Urgent, take heed to send Aššur-malik and Irma-Aššur, my witnesses that they entrusted the tin, to the representatives of Lalum there. 
Wherever there is a single shekel of silver make them pay so that my silver is not lost. 
Requesting the collection of ikribu funds
40-41I deposited 15 minas tin, the ikribu of Aššur, into the sack of Ikunum. 42Make him pay.
