25-26The accounting concerning Abum-ili's enterprise has not taken place. 27-29I asked Turaya, who said: "I balanced 12 shekels of silver for Iddin-Suen." 
30Twice I have written to you. 31-33Within 3 months after they have paid the balance (and) the price of the textiles has been received, Abum-ilum must pay the balance to you. 
33-34If he does not pay, he must add interest for me. 35Why has he not paid in accordance with his contract?

From Assur-idi to Assur-nada: 
Body
3-4The words of the gods are urgent! 4-7Why do you keep renouncing your obligations towards the house of Ennanum? 
8Please, do not renounce them! 9You will perish! 10-14As to Assur-malik, if he wants to give you even 1 shekel of silver as an investment loan, don't receive it! 
15-17If he appoints you to be his representative, don't do it! 17-18Say instead: "I am on my way to the City." 
19-23
Because of Puzur-Assur's message you are not to enter (the house), and do not try to sell the textiles all over the place.
 24-25Stand outside together with the shareholders and observe the textiles and the silver that come out. 
26-28If they divide up the textiles, then stand by and join in the division for our share. 28-30Since divine Assur would then humble me, do not become a slave of the entire country. 
31-33... they refuse to come out, let he who wishes to sell all over the place do so, but you should not be involved.
