25-26The accounting concerning Abum-ili's enterprise has not taken place. 27-29I asked Turaya, who said: "I balanced 12 shekels of silver for Iddin-Suen." 
30Twice I have written to you. 31-33Within 3 months after they have paid the balance (and) the price of the textiles has been received, Abum-ilum must pay the balance to you. 
33-34If he does not pay, he must add interest for me. 35Why has he not paid in accordance with his contract?

1-5From Šu-hubur and the sons of Aššur-imitti to Buzutaya, Pušu-ken and Imdi-ilum: 
Pursuing Ikunum's assets
5-12We received here the tablet of the city concerning Ikunum son of Samaya and his clearing and Puzur-ili son of Il-bani our attorney brings the tablet of the city to you (pl.). 
13-26There, assist Puzur-ili our attorney to clear Ikunum concerning his narruqum-capital. When you have cleared the man, let your message come from the city with the first traveller so that here we may impose his 'thirds' from whatever there is of Ikunum's and take them. 
27-29Also, take a sealed tablet with his seal from when they clear (him).

3-4The words of the gods are urgent! 4-7Why do you keep renouncing your obligations towards the house of Ennanum? 
8Please, do not renounce them! 9You will perish! 10-14As to Aššur-malik, if he wants to give you even 1 shekel of silver as an investment loan, don't receive it! 
15-17If he appoints you to be his representative, don't do it! 17-18Say instead: "I am on my way to the City." 
19-23
Because of Puzur-Aššur's message you are not to enter (the house), and do not try to sell the textiles all over the place.
 24-25Stand outside together with the shareholders and observe the textiles and the silver that come out. 
26-28If they divide up the textiles, then stand by and join in the division for our share. 28-30Since divine Assur would then humble me, do not become a slave of the entire country. 
31-33... they refuse to come out, let he who wishes to sell all over the place do so, but you should not be involved.
