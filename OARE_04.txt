Aššur-taklaku complains about Aššur-nada's requests
Why have you written me as follows: 4-5The 2 textiles which you left with me I have sent to you in Durhumit. 
6-8Also, I have promised to take 1/3 mina of silver, the price of a donkey, out of that which Amur-Ištar will send me. 
9-10Send me the 1/3 mina of silver plus the goods purchased in the City. 10 black textiles worth 5 or 6 (shekels) each plus 2 hides they refused to recieve on your account in the colony office, so you sent them with Šalim-beli to Durhumit. 
17-23At the rate of 8 shekels a piece their value was 1 1/3 mina 5 shekels of silver together with the proceeds from the hides. I sent the 1 1/3 minas 4 shekels of silver under my seal plus 1 shekel, the transport tariff to your representatives, and they sent it on to you with Ennam-Belum. 
23-28When I left for the city you said in your message: "Let our father take their price out of the silver of Ennam-Belum." 
28-29They had already let the silver leave to go to you, so he took it from out of my shipment. 30-31But you had not written me any message that I must give hiim the price of the donkey! 
32-3313 shekels of silver was the transport tariff for the 13 minas of silver. 33-37As to the 17 shekels of silver about which you said: "They are for your sacrifices"--but apart fromteh 10 shekels which you gave me I have not taken anything. 
38-39Yet, you have deducted the price of a donkey. 39-40Check your notes there. 40-42My note and the message which you sent with Anninum are there too, so keep that in mind!

This letter is particularly interesting becasue of the relationship it highlights between Pušu-ken and the traveller. Somewhere in Anatolia, Ahu-waqar is making his way, perhaps back toward Kaneš. During the journey, it seems that he was waylaid while his donkeys were at teh disposal of an Ennam-Aššur, who had taken them to a guard post or the like. When Ennam-Aššur returned, he pressed Ahu-waqar to change the situation between himself and Pušu-ken. Ennam-Aššur held Ahu-waqar's hem or fringe,of siginificant legal importance, which rendered Ahu-waqar stuck. Pušu-ken and Ennam-Aššur had a dispute over silver, and he was using Ahu-waqar, successfully, as leverage. The tone of Ahu-waqar's letter reveals the interesting thing about the interchange. Though Ennam-Aššur coudl apparently tie Ahu-waqar close enough to force Pušu-ken to negotiate over the matter, Ahu-waqar still felt a need to importune Pušu-ken for help, explaining that he needed to be on his way, as though his interests were not necessarily obvious to Pušu-ken.

8-12He said, "Give me the silver, the price of the goods which I entrusted to you so that Pušu-ken comes and negotiates/discusses with me." 
13-21I said, "The silver which he brought to Kaneš came and you and Pušu-ken discuss and if the silver returns to the property of Pušu-ken, let him take it, and if it returns to your property, you (will) take it."  
22-24He said, "Let Pušu-ken come and let him discuss with me." 24-25The man holds my fringe. 25-26And he is repeatedly giving me to the guarantors. 
Making the plea
27-32My dear father and lord, when you read my tablet, take a strong tablet from the colony office so that I may get up and come.

With respect to the 40 minas--I take divine Aššur as witness that I shall not make any concessions to you regarding interest, which runs from the month Mahhur-ili, eponymy Iddin-Aššur, the son of Kubi-idi.

Aššur-taklaku takes issue with U?ur-ša-Aššur
4-7Why is it that you said" "1 5/6 mina 7 1/2 shekels of silver from the stocks booked in the name of Aššur-taklaku in the colony office will accrue to me." 
8We cleared account and you were to receive 1/2 mina. 9The rest belongs to our father. 9-10Moreover, I wrote a note and gave you a copy. 
11Check your copy. 11-12Take for yourself what you were booked for. 12-13Transfer the rest to our father's account. 
14-20When I came up (to Anatolia) I questioned you, saying: "Did you deposit our father's share? Take either silver or textiles, my dear brother and let him be booked for a full share in the colony office. Do not direct our father's anger towards yourself!" 
21-23You answered: "Your father has indeed deposited a full share. Aššur-nada left me silver and textiles." 
23-24While I was still there, there arose a possibility of a šitapkum-investment of 9 textiles each. 
24-26I brought 10 textiles up to the palace and said: "They will invest them at the accounting." 26-27You answered: "(Only) who is present will deposit." 
27-28You did not return to the accounting so they invested 9 textiles for each. 28-29You told me several times that it was 7 textiles each. 
29-32You did deposit the 2 textiles you borrowed from me so as to fill up our father's account, but you wrote your own name! 
32-33Is it proper that you cheat me instead of giving me correct information? 34-35Today, if it had been some 10 shekels of silver, why, that would have been a boon for me. 
35-42Instead, of speaking out you said to yourself: "The man in staying in the City, let us deposit some of his own silver from your share and transfer it on top of the 7 textiles that I have deposited; then add 3 mians of silver to our own father's account whereever we may meet.

OARE Development:  Hooked up with Old Cuneiform Arrangement
This letter preserves Šu-hubur's ongoing attempt to extract his assets from two people's property. The first person is Ikunum. Ikunum's health is failing and investors are trying to pull out their money before he dies (for more see explanation on Ikunum's failing health and finances). Some of Ikunum's investors have been able to get Ikunum to hand over the capital from his naruqqum fund, though at a dissapointing rate. If, like other known example, they bought shares valued at 1 mina of gold for four minas of silver, they are now only able to salvage half their investments. Šu-hubur directs Pušu-ken to try to interact with Ikunum nicely in the hopes that Pušu-ken will be able to procure more than the Šu-hubur's colleagues have been able, perhaps by as much as a mina of silver more. If Pušu-ken's efforst fail, Šu-hubur is prepared to take legal matters to try to prevent such losses. At the end of the letter, Šu-hubur also reminds Pušu-ken to collect a smaller amount of tin (5 minas) from Ikunum.
The second person is Lalum, who had purchased a talent tin from Šu-hubur's goods when he met with caravaneers (Aššur-malik and Irma-Aššur) transporting those goods through hahhum. Since then Lalum has passed away, and Šu-hubur is trying collect the silver from that credit sale. Those managing the division of Lalum's estate tell him that he will have to seek collection elsewhere, though admitting that the likelihood is quite small that he will recover his money. Šu-hubur then urges Pušu-ken to collect the silver wherever it can be found. Pušu-ken is to gather the caravaneers to witness the transaction.

Epistolary Formula
1-2From Šu-hubur to Pušu-ken: 
Directing the pursuit to collect of some silver
3-8You wrote, (saying) "Ikunum's investors have gotten out 2 minas of silver for each mina of gold for their gold (shares)." 
9-12If you judge look on him kindly, then he will give you an additional, (i.e.) three mina rate, instead of two mina rate. 
12Come to an agreement (with him). 13-18If after the 2 minas he does give up to you an addition, write me so that I may impose his 'thirds' here and bind my silver in the city. 
Urging the collection of assets from a deceased merchant
Concerning the 1 talent of tin which Aššur-malik and Irma-Aššur sold to Lalum in hahhum, I have written to you several times (saying) "Here, I requested silver from the estate of Lalum, and they said, 'Write to wherever you sold him the tin and take your silver there; (but) there is no silver belonging to Lalum in the feild (Anatolia).'" 
32-38Urgent, take heed to send Aššur-malik and Irma-Aššur, my witnesses that they entrusted the tin, to the representatives of Lalum there. 
Wherever there is a single shekel of silver make them pay so that my silver is not lost. 
Requesting the collection of ikribu funds
40-41I deposited 15 minas tin, the ikribu of Aššur, into the sack of Ikunum. 42Make him pay.
