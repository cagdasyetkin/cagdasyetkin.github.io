salim-ahum writes to his son intending for him to come home. As such he instructs him to take care of some issues and leave others for another journey to Anatolia.  From another letters that discuss Ennam-Assur's concerns about the Anatolians (AKT 3 67), it is clear that the discussion to bring Ennam-Assur home was an ongoing one. salim-ahum in intent that Ennam-Assur will leave his personal business in Anatolia, including matters regarding his own naruqqum, in the care of his brother Dan-Assur during his return, demonstrating both the ease with which such a matter could be undertaken and its marked character as salim-ahum felt the need to explicitly discuss it. 
When Ennam-Assur comes, salim-ahum desires him to arrive with several specific goods, including a table top (to be had from Agua son of ?ab-Assur), half a talent of fine copper (part to be acquired in Kanesh and part in hahhum). Perhaps in exchange, salim-ahum promises his son that he will give him 16 ½ shekels gold which Lipit-Suen(?) in simala apparently owes Ennam-Assur. The specific goods may have been related to Ennam-Assur's imminent marriage to the daughter of su-hubur, who wrote Pusu-ken hoping to ensure that Ennam-Assur was pleased during his time in Anatolia (VS 26 64).

Warning the correspondent about the attitude of the colony
43-46  Satisfy (the silver) a month. I (already) pressed the colony, saying, "Let them stand for a man."

51-52On account of these things, I am delaying U?ur-sa-Assur.

Summary 
The topic of the preserved portion of the letter has to do with Pusu-ken purchasing real estate in Assur. He was pursuing this activity as seen in several other letters (TTC 6, Schaeffer 22, TC 2 2). As evident from those letters, su-hubur, a senior merchant also intimately involved with Pusu-ken's commerical operations, had been helping to arrange the purchase of a house for Pusu-ken, going so far as to conclude the purchase of the house. He did so without consulting salim-ahum, which frustrated the latter. salim-ahum had thought that a lack of competition for the house and patience woudl yeild a lwoer price. However, when su-hubur closed the deal, salim-ahum still decided to pay for 10 of the 16 minas silver from his own accounts so that the entirety woudl not be taken out as a loan on Pusu-ken's behalf. While nothing in this letter eliminates the possibility that this letter discussed a differenc occasion on which saim-ahum had paid out silver for Pusu-ken in the process of helping him conclude the purchase of a house, it seems likely that these two events were one and the same. If so, then salim-ahum's allusion to the house(s) of su-hubur having been seized a second time is difficult to parse. The rendering bete suggests that the legal sense of ?abatum refers somehow to the architectural structure rather than the household. Nonetheless, the most likely context for th eremark has something to do with financial consequences of the house purchase for which salim-ahum is seeking remuneration.
