A few days ago, I learnt that it is possible to keep a blog up and running using Github and RStudio from our instructor [Eduardo Ari√±o de la Rubia.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/earino/ "EduardoLink") and started building one.

The site contains my Final Project, quizes we had and some tutorials. All done during the Unstructured Text Data Course offered by MSc Business Analytics program  of [Central European University](https://courses.ceu.edu/programs/ms/master-science-business-analytics "CEULink")
